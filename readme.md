# amdki

the name comes from `anki` and `md` folded into one word. this was a fun friday night project
that i outsourced to Claude 3 Opus. i've been using anki again recently and wanted a way to 
automate creation of flashcards, which i create and pre-format in a markdown file that i use 
for notetaking on that subject. it wouldn't have been that big of an effort to copy everything 
over manually, but this was short enough in development time, all thanks to my AI friend 
providing a skeleton for me to start with and finish up on my own, that i think i did save 
myself time by doing this.

you can use the jar in 'Releases' or compile it yourself. there are no dependencies.
